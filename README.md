# Dashball
As in a dashboard for all devices

It is a work in progress.

Stay tuned for the first official release.
## Setup
WARNING: The development is still in alpha. 

Install Python3.12 with the [Microsft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NCVDN91XZQP?ocid=pdpshare)

Download an unzip the .zip file.

Execute `install.bat`

That is it!

To update the program you can do these 2 steps again, the install.bat file is designed to work many times.

## Use case
Dashball is not one of those cloud monitoring software. 

We create a webserver with all the information you need to remotely check in on your system.
## Supported operating systems
None! It is still a work in progress

We are first working on Windows 10/11 and we then want to work on Ubuntu.
